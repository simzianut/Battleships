                    <p class="inceput in-wrapper">Battleship is a fascinating story of how an abstract idea, born from the anxieties of modern naval warfare, evolved into a global cultural phenomenon. Its origins are, ironically, as hidden as the ships on its grid. The game is believed to have emerged as a "folk" or "parlor" pastime in the early 20th century, a period dominated by a naval arms race and the dawn of Dreadnought-class battleships. Rudimentary versions, played with pencil and paper, were popular among officers in various nations, including Russia and France, before and during World War I. These early games, often called "Salvo" or "L'Attaque," were a perfect simulation of the "fog of war": two opponents, separated by a barrier of the unknown, blindly attempting to strike an invisible enemy. The 10x10 grid wasn't just a game board; it was a representation of the vast ocean, and each coordinate called out was the equivalent of firing an artillery salvo into the void, hoping for an impact.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p class="inceput">For decades, that's how it remained—a public-domain game, much like Tic-Tac-Toe or Hangman. Companies like Starex in 1931 began selling pre-printed notepads with grids, slightly standardizing the experience, but the true revolution came in 1967. The Milton Bradley company had the genius idea of transforming the game from paper to plastic. This transition was far more than a simple change in material; it was a masterpiece of industrial and psychological design. The two folding, plastic cases weren't just packaging; they formed the iconic "battle stations," creating a perfect physical barrier that guaranteed secrecy. Furthermore, they introduced the "pegs." The tactile satisfaction of plugging in a white peg for a "Miss" and, especially, a vibrant red peg for a "Hit," provided an immediate sensory reward that paper never could. By standardizing the fleet to the five classic ships (Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, Submarine, Destroyer), Milton Bradley created a universal set of rules. And then, there was the marketing masterstroke: popularizing the catchphrase, "You sunk my Battleship!" This line transformed the simple elimination of a game piece into a dramatic, personal, and triumphant (or devastating) moment, cementing the game in the public consciousness and securing its place in every living room for generations to come.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>

                <p>The story of Battleship doesn't start with plastic pegs or a factory; it begins as a "folk game," passed from person to person with just a pencil and paper.</p>
                <p>Its exact origin is a bit hazy, lost to time like a ship in the fog, but it's widely believed to have emerged in the early 1900s. This was a time when naval power was dramatically increasing. Massive new ships called "dreadnoughts" were the high-tech superweapons of their day, and tensions were building toward World War I.</p>
                <p>For decades, Battleship remained a public-domain game, like Tic-Tac-Toe or Hangman. Anyone could play it at any time.</p>
                <p>In 1931, a company called Starex decided to commercialize it in the United States. They released it as a paper-and-pencil game in a pad, giving it the catchy, naval-themed name: "Salvo."</p>
                <p>The "Salvo" rules were slightly different from what many of us play today. Instead of firing one shot per turn, players would fire a "salvo" of multiple shots. The number of shots you got was often equal to the number of ships you still had floating. For example, at the start of the game, you'd get to call out five coordinates all at once. As your ships were sunk, your "firepower" (number of shots) would decrease.</p>
                <p>Other companies, including the Milton Bradley Company, also released their own paper-pad versions under names like "Broadsides" or "Naval Combat." It was a popular, cheap travel game, but it hadn't yet become the icon we know.</p>
                <h3>The plastic revolution</h3>
                <p>The game truly changed forever in 1967. This is when Milton Bradley, who had been selling the paper version, had a revolutionary idea. They decided to transform Battleship from a disposable pad into a self-contained, 3D board game.</p>
                <p>This new design was a work of genius for several reasons:</p>
                <ol>
                     <li><b>The "Briefcase" Design</b>: The game came in two folding plastic cases. This was brilliant. It not only stored all the pieces but, when opened, it created a perfect vertical barrier. Each player's "ocean grid" was completely hidden from their opponent, solving the "no peeking" problem forever.</li>
                     <li><b>The Pegboard System</b>: The grids were now pegboards. This allowed for two key innovations:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Plastic Ships: You no longer had to draw. You had a physical fleet of five standardized ships (the Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, Submarine, and Destroyer) that you could physically plug into your board.</li>
                        <li>Red and White Pegs: This was the masterstroke. A white peg in your "target grid" (the top vertical part) marked a "Miss." A red peg marked a "Hit." This created a permanent, visual record of the battle, allowing you to hunt for ships with logic.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>The Slogan</b>: The game's marketing was just as brilliant. The company created and popularized one of the most famous catchphrases in board game history: "<b>You sunk my Battleship!</b>" This dramatic, triumphant (or agonizing) cry cemented the game in pop culture.</li>
                </ol>
